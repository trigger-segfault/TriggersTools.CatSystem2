trigger_death's Changes:
* This is based off of ClrPlus.Windows.PeBinary.RsourceLib and heavily modified to improve resource management.
* Many issues have been fixed when resaving resources. ResourceIds no longer leak memory from string pointers
* Menu and Dialogs now have base interfaces for working with Normal or Extended versions, along with different menu item types.
